## What is it?
fpVideoExplorer is an open-source application that allows users to preview peri event time windows of fiber photometry data recorded using Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT) systems.<br>
The application can:<br>
- extract peri event time window and save the signal as an animation (*.mp4)
- extract matched peri event time window of the recorded video and save it as a separate video file (*.avi)
- synchronize both: peri event video and the animated signal and save it as a separate video file (*.avi)<br>
## Usage
